# Youtube to Podcast

This is an example of a primitive app made using [Beeware](https://beeware.org/). Check their tutorial to find more.

My goal here was to create something simple and effective to be able to convert "talking head" YouTube videos to audio and save them as a podcast.
I ended up building a small Android application.
